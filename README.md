# 🎨 Mood-Based Landing Page

A simple, interactive landing page built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of the **Vibe Coding** movement. This project was developed using **Cursor** and serves as a learning experiment to explore how visual design and behavior can dynamically adapt based on user mood selection.
